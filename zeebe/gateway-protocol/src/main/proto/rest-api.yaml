        * `followUpDate` - reset by providing an empty String

        Providing any of those attributes with a `null` value or omitting it preserves
        the persisted attribute's value.

        The assignee cannot be adjusted with this endpoint, use the Assign task endpoint.
        This ensures correct event emission for assignee changes.
